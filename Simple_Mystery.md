# Simple Mystery
Points: 300

### Description
The mystery machine is on the case. But the machine can only get clues for the flag. Perhaps you could solve the full mystery of the hidden flag.

## My Approach
1. I downloaded the provided file and first thing I got in my head was to try `strings` command on it.
2. After looking at the output of `strings` command, I found some interesting lines.
3. Parts of the flag were shredded and were present in different lines.

4. I scrolled through the output and found all the parts of the flag.
5. I concatenated all the parts and got the flag.
